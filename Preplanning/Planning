This will be used to find the impact point of targets

Requirements:
Be able to both actively track the ground and actively track existing grids, as well as target specific points
Work in both space and gravity, with an abitrary targetting distance for space, or target a specific point based off GFS
Easy camera setup and movement, based off the camera tracker
Easy enable and disable, similiar to camera tracker
Be able to work for: bullets, missile and grids, with equivalent acceleration for each
Be able to add arbitrary things like height and speeds to help with alternate uses
Be able to operate independently of GFS as well

Progress:
Add all required changable variables
#Get GFS feeding info into system
#Set up text panel output for general information from the system
Set up calculation for standard bullet drop and non-speed limit grid drop
Set up camera control system and test it operates the same as camera pointer
Get the camera control to point to the target point
Test on firing range to make sure targetting is accurate in gravity
Get grid tracking working
Test on moving target
Work on targetting in space and finishing touchs
