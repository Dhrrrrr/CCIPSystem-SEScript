Class level info such as height

Program()
{
  Locate the GFS script block 
  Collect necessary blocks I.E Camera and turret parts

  Set run speed
}

Runtime() 
{
  Get inputs from users and change system off what their commands are
  Get DAGGER output
  Get height/distance from target
  Calculate any velocity offsets due to both our velocity and the targets velocity
  Calculate the distance/position the bullet will hit
  Calculate the angles for the camera to turn to it
  Use PID to switch camera to the target
